                                        Every organization needs feedback to improve. Surveys are a powerful tool to
                                        collect that feedback, but creating a survey to get that useful data can seem
                                        hard. At SurveyKing, we make it simple!

                                        The most important step is to know your objective. Why are you sending out a
                                        survey? What insights are you hoping to gain? What specific data do you need?
                                        Make sure to keep your survey concise and on track based on your objective.

                                        Keep similar questions together to give your survey a logical and focused feel.
                                        Using multiple pages, page titles and instructions help people understand what
                                        you're asking and why.

                                        Don't cram all questions on one page. Spread your questions out over multiple
                                        pages so respondents do not feel overwhelmed.

                                        A question should only encompass one idea at a time to keep your audience
                                        focused and to make sure they can understand what youâ€™re asking. Multi-topic
                                        questions can be confusing and tricky to answer.
                                    </p>

                                        Spell out everything that could be interpreted in more than one way. Do you want
                                        to know if someone was satisfied with their purchase? Make sure you specify
                                        whether you're talking about the product cost, the shipping, customer service
                                        experience or another specific metric.

                                        The question text and number of questions should be held to a minimum to keep
                                        respondents motivated to complete your survey.
                                    </p>

                                        Make sure that respondents remain focused by only showing them relevant
                                        questions. Use logic to skip irrelevant questions. For example, if you have a
                                        set of questions pertaining to males and females, put those questions on
                                        different pages and use logic to only show the appropriate ones
                                    </p>

                                        Avoid the <a href="#!">matrix</a> question type when possible. Sometimes
                                        respondents will focus
                                        on filling in the grid rather than focusing their attention on each sub-question
                                        (row choices). This will impact the quality of your data.

                                        Use words rather than numbers when asking respondents to <a href="#!">rate</a>.
                                        When creating
                                        answer choices, use descriptions such as "slightly satisfied" or "extremely
                                        satisfied" rather than numbers such as "2" or "4" to indicate rating. Answer
                                        choices with words are easier for people to understand and rank.

                                        A multiple choice question allows respondents to choose from a predefined list
                                        of answers. The fewer the amount of answer choices, the less cumbersome it is
                                        for your respondents.

                                        A dropdown question allows respondents to choose from a predefined list of
                                        answers. A dropdown question is useful in situations where you have a large set

                                        The most important step is to know your objective. Why are you sending out a

                                        The Single Textbox question allows you to collect short open-ended answers from
                                        respondents. You can also validate the question to require answers in a specific
                                        format. This question type is best, if you want to gather any type of open-ended
                                        response, usually when answers will vary greatly and can't be predefined.
